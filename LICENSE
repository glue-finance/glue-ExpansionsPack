and comprehensively to encompass, without limitation, any and all forms of direct 
or indirect monetary or economic benefit, including but not limited to:

- Receipt of fiat currency through any transfer mechanism, payment processor, or 
  financial institution;

  blockchain-based value representation;
- Collection of protocol fees in any denomination, token, or non-fungible token (NFT);

  form of financial backing where the funds are obtained based on, or in connection 
  with, activities related to the counterfeit version of Glue V1;
- Launching, minting, distributing, or selling any token, coin, or NFT whose value, 
  utility, functionality, or market perception is directly or indirectly correlated 
  to or derived from the counterfeit version of Glue V1 or any not permitted 
  activities under this License;
- Receiving any form of compensation, revenue-sharing, profit distribution, dividend, 
  royalty, commission, or incentive;

  converted to monetary value.

ENFORCEMENT RIGHTS: Glue Labs Inc. (Delaware), as the exclusive owner of all 
intellectual property rights and licensable components of Glue V1, hereby reserves 
and retains the absolute and unilateral right, at its sole discretion, to impose 
fees, restrict access, implement technical limitations, or otherwise enjoin the 
usage of any software, application, or implementation that contravenes the terms 
of this License, including but not limited to unauthorized forks, counterfeit 
versions, or non-compliant integrations. Notwithstanding any other remedies 
available at law or in equity, Glue Labs Inc. may deploy technological measures 
to identify and restrict functionality of unauthorized implementations. Any fee 
structure imposed shall be determined exclusively by Glue Labs Inc. and may be 
modified at any time without prior notice. User hereby acknowledges that any 
attempt to circumvent such restrictions constitutes a material breach of this

incurred in enforcing these provisions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additional Enforcement Rights for Non-Monetized Infringement

ENFORCEMENT AGAINST NON-MONETIZED COUNTERFEIT VERSIONS: Notwithstanding the 
absence of direct or indirect monetary gain as defined in "earn money" above, 
Glue Labs Inc. (Delaware), as the exclusive owner of all intellectual property 
rights and licensable components, hereby expressly reserves all rights, remedies, 
and causes of action against any entity or individual who creates, deploys, 
maintains, promotes, or otherwise facilitates a counterfeit version of Glue V1, 
regardless of whether such version generates revenue or other economic benefit. 
For avoidance of doubt:

- Mandatory Cessation and Desist: Glue Labs Inc. retains the unequivocal and 
  non-waivable right to demand and enforce immediate cessation of operation, 
  distribution, and availability of any counterfeit implementation of Glue V1, 
  and may, at its sole discretion, pursue all available technological, contractual, 
  and legal mechanisms to effectuate such cessation;
- Comprehensive Damages Recovery: In the event of deployment or operation of a 
  counterfeit version of Glue V1, Glue Labs Inc. shall be entitled to seek and 
  recover all direct, indirect, consequential, special, punitive, and exemplary 
  damages attributable to such infringement, including but not limited to: 
  (i) monetary losses; (ii) reputational harm; (iii) market confusion; 
  (iv) diminution of brand value; (v) costs of enforcement; and (vi) reasonable 
  attorney's fees and litigation expenses;
- Personal and Corporate Liability: Glue Labs Inc. expressly reserves the right 
  to pursue legal action against both the corporate entities and individual 
  persons responsible for or contributing to any infringement hereunder, including 
  but not limited to developers, deployers, operators, promoters, and financial 
  beneficiaries of counterfeit implementations, regardless of the scope or extent 
  of their participation;
- Chain Analysis and Identity Verification: In furtherance of enforcing its rights 
  hereunder, Glue Labs Inc. may, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, 
  engage with blockchain analytics providers, compliance officers, regulatory 
  authorities, and law enforcement agencies to: (i) trace and analyze on-chain 
  activities related to counterfeit implementations; (ii) identify wallet addresses 
  associated with such activities; (iii) correlate such addresses with personal 
  identifying information; and (iv) pursue all available channels to ascertain the 
  legal identities of persons engaged in unlicensed counterfeit activities. The User 
  hereby acknowledges that blockchain transaction data is publicly available and 
  subject to analysis, and that anonymity on public blockchains is not guaranteed.

The foregoing enforcement provisions shall be construed to provide Glue Labs Inc. 
(Delaware) with the broadest possible remedial scope permitted under applicable law, 
and any ambiguity shall be resolved in favor of protecting Glue Labs Inc. (Delaware)'s 
intellectual property, contractual, and proprietary rights. The User hereby 
acknowledges that any involvement with counterfeit implementations constitutes a 
knowing and material breach of this License and may subject the User to substantial 
legal liability.
